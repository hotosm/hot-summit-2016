<h3>What’s the HOT Summit?</h3>
<p>The second annual HOT Summit will bring together people from around the world working to make open geographic data available to improve the places they live and work through OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>Two separate tracks will focus on technology and community building. Sessions will be a mix of workshops, presentations, lighting talks and roundtable discussions, with plenty of space and time for meeting fellow HOT community members, hacking, talking and collaboration.</p>

<h3>Should I attend?</h3>
<p>Whether you’re a community builder, development professional, educator, geographer, humanitarian, journalist, philanthropist, programmer, volunteer mapper, or want to learn more about open data and OpenStreetMap -- you’re invited and welcome!</p>

<h3>Why is this year special?</h3>
<p>This year’s theme is <strong><i>OpenStreetMap, The Global HOT Community, and Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals</i></strong>.</p>
<p>Approved in 2015, the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300" target='_blank'>17 Sustainable Development Goals</a> emphasize participation from all sectors of society to meet ambitious targets around the world’s most critical challenges by 2030. Data, in particular open spatial data being collected globally in OpenStreetMap, has a significant role to play in not only contributing to the goals but also in monitoring and evaluating progress. Above and beyond the data itself, the way in which it is collected through HOT’s participatory process is also making an important contribution. Whether it’s mapping for health, education, water and sanitation, financial inclusion, or disaster risk reduction, the 2016 Summit will explore the ways HOT and OSM are already contributing and how our work can align with the goals moving forward.</p>
