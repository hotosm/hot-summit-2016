description: The 2015 floods in Chennai got a small group of hackers in India to build a simple flooded reporting app that was eventually used for rescue coordination and had more than a million views during the 1 week period of heavy rains. This became an effective demonstration of how the latest open mapping tools can effectively be used to build extremely valuable public services in times of crisis at virtually no cost. In this lightning talk, I will demonstrate how a simple report crowdsourcing app can be built using open source code for a specific emergency and published live within minutes.
