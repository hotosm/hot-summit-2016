description: In this lightning talk I will portray about the outreach effort and the future of several successful programs that promote OSM and teach it to aspiring mappers. Stats UP, Mapillary`s ambassadors program and School of Data will be covered and quickly analyzed to show how the contagion of OpenStreetMap is spreading. These programs can bring lessons for HOTOSM on the ground sustainability after natural disasters and humanitarian activities are deployed.
