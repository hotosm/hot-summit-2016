  </div>

<div class='limiter pad4y clearfix prose'>

	<p>The HOT Summit 2016 is a conference designed for everyone using and interested in OpenStreetMap and humanitarian mapping. Our goal is to bring together the diverse users that make up OpenStreetMap and the HOT worldwide community and to make everyone feel welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in the event, sessions, and conversations. The growing diversity of the OpenStreetMap community includes hobbyists and professionals, people of different ethnic backgrounds and gender identities, rich and poor, etc. This is the OpenStreetMap community and are all welcome and encouraged to attend the HOT Summit.</p>
	<p>To achieve this we require that everyone participating in the HOT Summit and related events treat everyone with respect and kindness, and acknowledge that people from different backgrounds have different understandings of what is offensive, derogatory, and unwelcoming, and commit to bridging this through positive communication.</p>
	<p>To ensure that the HOT Summit and related events are welcoming and safe experiences for everyone who attends we have adopted the following code of conduct:</p>
	<div style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 100px;">
	<p>HOT Summit 2016 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or background. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:</p>
	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or background; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
	<p>Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment. </p>
	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
	<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. [Conference staff can be identified by shirts/special badges] </p>
	<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel staff, venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. </p>

	<p>We expect participants to follow this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events. </p>
	<p><span style="font-size: smaller;">This anti-harassment policy is based on <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment" target='_blank'>the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by <a href="https://adainitiative.org/" target='_blank'>the Ada Initiative</a> and other volunteers.
