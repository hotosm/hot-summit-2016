description: The map changes a lot, when all kind of people are able to create them. Two examples from Nicaragua and Kyrgyzstan show, how the map gives young people the opportunity to participate as thinkers and implementers, identify places of risk and propose solutions to the problems. “These kinds of initiative share new knowledge and encourage innovation. These experiences can change children’s lives and also have the potential to change their environment and—why not?—the world.” (Philippe Barragne-Bigot, UNICEF Representative in Nicaragua)
